# Motion_and_Temp
In this project I have used:
1. Arduino Uno 
2. PIR Sensor 
3. Regulator (For temp varying)
4. Led
5. Buzzer
6. Breadboard

In this I have connected pir sensor, regulator, buzzer and led to arduino. I have used regulator to replace temperature sensor because room temperature was same and for varying the temperature I have used regulator. If we recieve temperature less than or equal to 10 and also detect a motion then red led and buzzer will be on and If we recieve temperature greater than or equal to 20 and also detect a motion then green led and buzzer will be on. If we don't recieve any motion led's will remain off.
